# Graph Fourier Transform for Directed Graphs

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for generating all the figures presented in the ICASSP 2024 paper titled "Frequency Analysis and Filter Design for Directed Graphs with Polar Decomposition".

## Dependencies

To run the code, certain Python packages are required. We strongly recommend using a virtual environment to avoid conflicts with other projects.

### Setting up a Virtual Environment

```bash
python3 -m venv env
```

```bash
source env/bin/activate
```

### Installing Required Packages

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
